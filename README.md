: The National youth tobacco survey is a national study that was designed to provide national data on long-term, intermediate, and short-term indicators key to the design, implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive tobacco prevention and control programs. The NYTS also serves as a baseline for comparing progress toward meeting selected Healthy People 2030 goals for reducing tobacco use among youth. The NYTS provides nationally representative data about middle and high school youth’s Tobacco-related beliefs, attitudes, behaviors exposure to pro- and anti-tobacco influences (Gentzke et al.,).
	In this project, we will focus on the following questions:
1.	What is the demographic distribution of heated tobacco users among middle and high school students?
2.	What proportion of middle and high school students use heated tobacco?
3.	What is the distribution of heated tobacco flavors among middle and high school students?
4.	How frequently do these students use heated tobacco?
5.	Where and how do these youths get heated tobacco?
II.	Dataset and variables of interest and relevance to research questions
The 2021 national youth tobacco survey was used (dataset: Nyts2021).
Among the 20413 participants ,305 of them responded that they use heated tobacco. All these 305 were used to respond to our research questions.
The following variables were used:
a)	Demographic variables: Participants’ age (QN1), Gender (QN2), their level of education (QN3) and their race (QN5).
b)	The number of days they used heated tobacco during the last 30 days (QN85).
c)	Different flavors of the heated tobacco participants use:  QN19J
d)	Ways participants got heated tobacco during the last 30 days:  QN20K , QN21K 
III.	The steps and results of your data quality control and integrity checks:
Using the 2021 National youths’ tobacco survey which has 20413 observations and 1334 variables I used 305 observations to answer my research questions.
The number of observations varied due to missing values for some variables.
I created SAS formats to help compute some tables and graphs of interest.
